# A grab bag of useful stuff


## To move all primary shards off of a node:

PUT /_cluster/settings
{
  "transient" :{
      "cluster.routing.allocation.exclude._name" : "<node name>"
   }
}


## Documentation on reading/writing documents:

https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-replication.html

Of note for writing to Elasticsearch, the write request is forwarded to the primary shard,
but the client doesn't receive a response until it has been replicated to all of
the currently in-sync replicas.
